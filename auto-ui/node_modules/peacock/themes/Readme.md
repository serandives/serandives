# peacock themes

These are the built in themes that come with peacock.

You can create more themes by copying and then editing the [empty
theme](https://github.com/thlorenz/peacock/blob/master/themes/empty.js) which is provided for that purpose.

The [hide semicolons theme](https://github.com/thlorenz/peacock/blob/master/themes/hide-semicolons.js) has the added
benefit of making all semicolons invisible. This makes code more readable at times.
